The lively lark stretched forth her wing,
The messenger of morning bright,
And with her cheerful voice did sing
The day’s approach, discharging night,
When that Aurora, blushing red,
Descried the guilt of Thetis’ bed.

I went abroad to take the air,
And in the meads I met a knight,
Clad in carnation colour fair;
I did salute this gentle wight,
Of him I did his name inquire.
He sighed, and said he was desire.

Desire I did desire to stay,
Awhile with him I craved to talk;
The courteous knight said me no nay,
But hand in hand with me did walk.
Then of desire I asked again
What thing did please and what did pain?

He smiled, and thus he answered then,
“Desire can have no greater pain
“Than for to see another man
“That he desireth to obtain;
“Nor greater joy can be than this,
“Than to enjoy that others miss.”
